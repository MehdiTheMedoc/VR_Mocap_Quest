**Oculus Quest Hands mocap**

it's 5AM, I'm not sober, I'm on my phone and someone on YouTube asked for this and I don't want to forget tomorrow. Understandably then the readme might be lacking



basically you install the apk on your headset, go in unknown sources and launch it.

you'll be in an empty room et you will be able to record the movements of your hands.
controllers are not supported so you'll have to hold the "menu" gesture and the app will start recording. once you done, redo the same gesture.

a .py file will be created in your headset, you can access it by USB file transfer with a PC. you'll then have to launch it in blender to have a rig playing your hands animation. 



I made that in 2021 so the script may be incompatible with recent blender versions 

the generated rig is UGLY. But it's workable since in my experience the animations did not need much cleaning.

I might forget a thing or two but if you know Blender a bit it should be ok


have fun!
